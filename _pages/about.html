    <h2>History</h2>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>Friends of Burma grew out of a very meaningful experience <strong>Neil and Diana Sowards</strong> had when they visited <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=burma&sll=19.0734338,96.67103989999998&sspn=26.941233752349255,58.85606086328304&t=m&dg=opt&hnear=Burma&z=4" target="_blank">Burma</a> in 1985. Neil's parents had worked in Burma as missionaries for over 30 years but he had never visited there. Friends of Burma is dedicated to helping the Christians of Burma in whatever way they want to be helped. About 80% of the Protestants are Baptists, so much of our work is with the Baptists. Christians number about 1.5 million in a country of about 50 million, most of whom are Buddhist. Evangelistic Christianity came to Burma with Adoniram Judson in 1813. Since 1966 no foreign missionaries have been allowed to reside in Burma, so all work is carried on by nationals.</p>

            <p>Burma (Myanmar) is in Southeast Asia, bounded by Thailand, Bangladesh, India, China, and Laos. It is ruled by an elected parliament with strong emphasis from the military. The UN lists Burma as one of the poorest countries in the world.</p>

            <p>The military junta changed the name from Burma to Myanmar in 1991 but our organization retains the old name which is more familiar to Americans.</p>

            <p>Over the years Friends of Burma, Inc. has grown. It incorporated as a Non Profit Corporation with the state of Indiana in 2006. It was approved by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization in its own right November 2007. It is governed by a board called the Executive Committee of sixteen which has an Annual Meeting in the Phoenix area in February or March. In the U. S. all work is done by volunteers with one paid financial secretary overseas. There is also an administrative board, which evaluates programs and makes recommendations.</p>
