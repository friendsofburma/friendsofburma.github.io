            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>To receive, administer and distribute money on behalf of the people and Christians of Burma for

                </li>
                <li>To initiate programs that would be helpful to the people and Christians of Burma.</li>
                <li>To locate and supply items such as books, seeds, plans, etc. that are requested by the leaders of
                    Burma or might be useful to them.
                </li>
                <li>To strengthen existing institutions, schools, orphanages, libraries, and other organizations that
                    are devoted to the good of the Burmese.
                </li>
                <li>To encourage the Christians of Burma by visits.</li>
                <li>To minister to Burmese theological students studying outside of Burma. To also aid students who are
                    studying other subjects, such as music, computer science, and agriculture, outside the country of
                    Burma.
                </li>
                <li>To make Americans aware of the needs of the Burmese.</li>
                <li>To solicit funds to meet the needs of the Burmese.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Friends of Burma is not political. All money collected goes to help the Burmese because one person
                underwrites the administrative costs, promotion, and overhead. This overhead is less than 1% of the
                money raised. ($1.00 for each $100.00)</p>

            <h2 class="my-header">The Orphan's Song</h2>
            <p>Phil, one of our Board members, wrote about the Orphan's Song:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Some children made parentless by war, storms and disease, sang for me. They sang so beautifully and with
                    such sweetness that it is hard to put into words. Despite their difficult circumstances, their faces
                    were so radiant, their voices so ardent and pure, that for a few brief minutes as they were singing, any
                    sadness I had felt was overcome by an almost limitless joy. It is easy to see why Jesus said that we
                    must become like little children, innocent and guileless. The song they sang was in Kayah, a language
                    from a remote mountainous region. The words are so appropriate:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dear mother, dear father, I am searching for you, Why have you gone away? I am so sad to live my
                    life without you. Dear mother, dear father, I long for you. But now by the grace of God, the church
                    and all its people have become my family. I sing praise to God for His love and goodness to me.
                </p>
